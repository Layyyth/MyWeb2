        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p class="scrollable-box">
          My name is Layth Abu Jafar, and I'm a 23-year-old Software Engineering undergraduate at Jordan University of
          Science and Technology. I've always believed that the true value lies in one's
          experiences and dedication.
          From an early age i got into computers as my family had high interests about technology so i got into it watching my
          uncle study his oracle vols. This diverse background instilled in me a strong work ethic and
          determination to excel.
          My journey into the world of coding was sparked by my uncle, a database administrator, who introduced me to
          the fascinating realm of software development. Instantly, I recognized that Software Engineering perfectly
          aligns with my problem-solving skills and leadership traits.
          Throughout my academic journey, I've actively participated in various local university contests, consistently
          achieving commendable placements. Presently, I have my sights set on the prestigious IEEEXtreme 2023
          competition, where I intend to showcase my abilities on a grand stage.
          I'm not just a student; I'm a driven individual who thrives on challenges, embraces new opportunities, and
          continuously seeks growth. Software Engineering isn't just my field of study; it's a passion that fuels my
          desire to innovate, collaborate, and lead.
          Oh and i like offroad vehicles.
